    <h1>A relization</h1>
<h2>I think I've just escaped the matrix. I've come to see myself as distracted and have a severe lack of focus. Of course I blame it on social media, video games, youtube, and most importantly myself. I will no longer let myself succumb to activities that offer instant-grattification and will focus my efforts on cutting out any and all forms of instant-gratificationit. The goal is to not use youtube, netflix, and video games at all. This is an endaveour that I've made quite a huge progress on, and I will soon detail the success I've had up-to now. But the battle for my attention is one that I've lost in the past and can easily loose again, and to win it back I must defeat those whom I'm facing. The social media companies who spend billions and software enginners who don't care about the destruction they cause as long as they get paid 6-figures and let everyone else be dammned. I will not touch any of their platforms. My goal is to quit them all together. I may not reach my goal, but alas they always say, "shoot for the stars land on the moon". That is what I'll do. In place on watching youtube or netflix i'll read books, i'll write, i'll journal, i'll design products and ideas, I'll code, I'll do anything. I will never let those depraved and greedy technology conglomorates farm my attention for profit any longer.</h2>
