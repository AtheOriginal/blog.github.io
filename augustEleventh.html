    <h1>Reflection</h1>
    <h2>I went outside today, like I do everyday; I went to the basketball court after which, I took a lap around the neighborhood where I did some self-reflection. I've come to realize that I've changed. That the person who I was June 16 2022 was not the same person I am today. I've made a lot of progress, and thats so refreshing. Never in my life have I seriously struggled in an area for so long as I have with working and studying. I could not study. I could not do what I planned to do for the day. It was not an easy thing to fix, it was something that takes time and multiple months to work at. I had to be comfortable at the uncomfortable, I had to push through the resistance, I had to do the work I didn't want to do especially when I felt like not doing it. And I didn't even realize that I pushed through everything and worked at least once everyday for multiple months until very recently. Next week will be my test of all the progress I made. No one will be home to check if I'm working or not. The only accountability that I have is myself and this blog. I will not fail, I will push through and complete my to-do lists, my tasks for the day. If I cannot do what I was placed here on earth to do, then what is the point, If I cannot prove the progress I've made than why boast about it. Keep an ear out for my logs on 8/15-8/20 as they will show if I've done something with my life.</h2>
